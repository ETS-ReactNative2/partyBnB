## 4.Technologies & Challenges

### 1.Architecture
PartyBnB is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). 
It features a frontend agnostic API in conjunction with client side rendering with React.

Additionally, bundling of client-side javascript is accomplished by Webpack, and Babel is used to transpile ES6+ Javascript for backward browser compatibility.

Backend: Node, Express, MongoDB

PartyBnB back-end HTTP API is expected to be relatively small since it's role is limited to retrieving user records and establishing a websocket connection to rapidly synchronize data between users.

Frontend: React and React Native with Redux
