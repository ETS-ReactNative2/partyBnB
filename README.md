## 2.Background and Overview
partyBnB, app inspired by AirBnB, is a social media application that allows users to share spots they can rent for parties. A user can book another users's party spot, in a location and leave reviews.

Price is important for customers booking online travel. PartyBnb is a web platform where users can rent out their real estate to clients needing a place to host their parties and where clients can save money, hosts can make money, and share the culture of the city.

* Hosts can post their space with an image and a description of their space.
* Travelers can search for spaces by location, see reviews, and make bookings.

Partybnb is primarily built with the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. MongoDB's geometries and Geospatial query reatures are used to allow users to search for spaces based on their query location.

## 4.Technologies & Challenges

### 1.Architecture
PartyBnB is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). 
It features a frontend agnostic API in conjunction with client side rendering with React.

Additionally, bundling of client-side javascript is accomplished by Webpack, and Babel is used to transpile ES6+ Javascript for backward browser compatibility.

Backend: Node, Express, MongoDB

Frontend: React and React Native with Redux

### 2.Technical challenges:
* Reading data from MongoDB database and organizing for display
* Implement search (by location & availability) & Google Maps on search
